<section id="motivação" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="motivação">Motivação</h2>
<p>A análise de trajetória e pseudotempo surgiu como uma solução para uma limitação inerente aos protocolos de RNA-seq de célula única: a perda de informação temporal. Durante o sequenciamento, as células são destruídas, impedindo o rastreamento dinâmico do processo biológico ao qual pertencem. Apesar disso, os processos de diferenciação celular são essencialmente contínuos e assimétricos, e essa progressão pode ser reconstruída computacionalmente com base na semelhança entre perfis transcricionais.</p>
<p>A reconstrução de trajetórias permite inferir o curso temporal de eventos celulares, identificar ramos de diferenciação e genes reguladores ao longo desses caminhos. O pseudotempo é uma variável latente que representa a posição relativa de cada célula nesse processo inferido. Este conceito é fundamental para estudos em desenvolvimento embrionário, resposta imune, plasticidade tumoral e outros processos biológicos com dinâmica celular.</p>
</section>
<section id="contextualização" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contextualização">Contextualização</h2>
<p>Neste tutorial, focaremos na análise de trajetória utilizando <strong>Monocle 3</strong>, uma ferramenta poderosa e flexível baseada em grafos para inferência de trajetórias celulares. Também faremos uso de pacotes auxiliares que se integram diretamente ao Monocle, como <strong>Seurat</strong>, para o pré-processamento e anotação dos dados, e <strong>ggplot2</strong> e <strong>dplyr</strong> para visualização e manipulação dos resultados.</p>
<p>Os principais pacotes utilizados serão:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seurat</strong>: usado para normalização, redução de dimensionalidade, clusterização e anotação de tipos celulares.</li>
<li><strong>Monocle 3</strong>: permite inferir grafos de trajetórias com múltiplas bifurcações, ordenar células ao longo do pseudotempo e realizar análises diferenciais.</li>
<li><strong>CytoTRACE2</strong>: permite inferir o nível de diferenciação de células com base no conteúdo transcricional.</li>
<li><strong>dplyr</strong>: para manipulação eficiente de dados tabulares.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ao longo do tutorial, utilizaremos um objeto Seurat previamente anotado, e demonstraremos como convertê-lo em um <code>cell_data_set</code>, construir trajetórias, inferir pseudotempo e identificar genes diferencialmente expressos ao longo do percurso celular.</p>

<p>Nesta etapa, aprenderemos a estrutura do grafo que representa as possíveis trajetórias celulares e ordenaremos as células ao longo do pseudotempo com Monocle 3. O ponto de início (“root”) é essencial para garantir que o pseudotempo reflita corretamente a progressão biológica esperada. Para uma abordagem biologicamente orientada, é possível utilizar ferramentas como <strong>CytoTRACE</strong>, que ranqueiam as células de acordo com seu grau de diferenciação, para identificar células menos diferenciadas como raízes.</p>
